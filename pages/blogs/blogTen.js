            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4">
              <p>Situated on the banks of the sacred Kshipra River, Ujjain is one of the seven holiest cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism. It's home to the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga, one of the twelve revered Jyotirlingas in India. The city also hosts the massive Simhastha Kumbh Mela every 12 years, drawing millions of devotees and tourists from around the globe.</p>
              <p>From temples like Harsiddhi Mandir, Kal Bhairav, and Mangalnath, to spiritual ghats and ancient observatories like Vedh Shala, Ujjain offers a mystical blend of spirituality and heritage.</p>
              <p className="italic">But all this spiritual grandeur calls for one key element—a stay that aligns with your peace of mind, comfort, and convenience.</p>
